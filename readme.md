### Description

---

Blackjack is one of the best known casino card games in the world. Played against a dealer, the goal for all the players at the blackjack table is to get a hand with a value that is higher than the dealer without going over 21.

The rules are simple, players get dealt a hand of two cards and some of the the basic options include:

- **Hit** and get dealt an additional card
- **Stay** and pass the turn over to the next player or to the dealer if all other players are finished
- **Split**, which is only available when the player is initially dealt two of the same card. The player gets dealt two additional cards, one to each of the "split" hand and the option to play both.

In this version, the player only has the option to either hit or stay and is only playing against a computer dealer.
